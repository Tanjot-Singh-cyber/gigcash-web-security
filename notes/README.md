# Notes (Mental Models & Understanding)

This directory contains **conceptual notes** used to internalize application security concepts.

## Purpose
- Convert lab experience into reusable mental models
- Capture *why vulnerabilities happen*, not just how to exploit them
- Build state-first and trust-based thinking

## What these notes contain
- Vulnerability mechanics
- Common trust failures
- State transitions and assumptions
- Backend behavior patterns
- Mistakes to avoid during testing

## What these notes do NOT contain
- Step-by-step lab solutions
- Payload lists
- Real application writeups

## Organization
- One file per vulnerability class (e.g. `xss.md`, `sqli.md`)
- Tool-agnostic and platform-independent
- Written for future recall, not teaching beginners

These notes support both:
- Guided labs (`/labs`)
- Real-world testing (`/writeups`)

They are **internal understanding**, not proof of work.
