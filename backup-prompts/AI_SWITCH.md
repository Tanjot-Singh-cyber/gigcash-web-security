If ChatGPT or my current AI becomes unavailable:

1. Use any capable LLM (Claude, Gemini, local LLM, etc.).
2. Paste MASTER_BOOTSTRAP.md first.
3. Paste SESSION_SEED.md second.
4. If needed, summarize current work from progress/ and notes/.
5. Continue without resetting my level.

Reminder:
The AI is a tool.
The roadmap, rules, and progress live in this repository.
