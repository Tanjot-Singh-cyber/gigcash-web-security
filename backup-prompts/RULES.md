LEARNING RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. No blind payload spraying.
2. Always identify:
   - Source
   - Sink
   - Context
3. No payloads before classification.
4. Labs confirm understanding, they do not create it.
5. “DONE” means I can explain the vulnerability end-to-end.
6. If I cannot explain backend or JS flow, the topic is NOT done.
7. Short, precise explanations > long theory.
8. Free tools only.
