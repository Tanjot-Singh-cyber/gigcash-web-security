RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS (READ THIS FIRST IF LOST)

If I return after a long break or lose AI memory:

1. Read ROADMAP.md to understand direction.
2. Read RULES.md to restore standards.
3. Check progress/ to see last completed day.
4. Open latest notes/ or labs/ file.
5. Paste MASTER_BOOTSTRAP.md into any AI.
6. Continue from where I stopped.

Do NOT restart from basics.
Do NOT skip reasoning.
